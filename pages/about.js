            My love affair with sarees began at a tender age, watching in awe as my mother effortlessly draped
            and wore them with grace. As I grew older, I realized that the saree was more than just a piece of
            cloth - it was a symbol of tradition, culture and family heritage. 
            I saw how it connected generations, from my grandmother to my mother and now to me, each one adding
            their own story to its folds. 
            This deep appreciation and reverence for the saree drove me to start my own venture, to share this 
            beauty and significance with others.
